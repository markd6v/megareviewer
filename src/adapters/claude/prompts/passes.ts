/** What each pass asks for. Sent after the cached PR data, so changing one doesn't cost a cache. */
export const PASS_INSTRUCTIONS: Readonly<Record<ModelPass, string>> = {
  intent: `Task: intent.

Work out what this pull request is meant to do and what it actually does.

- stated: what the description, tickets, commit messages and branch name say the PR should do, in one or two sentences. List the sources that say it (ref is the ticket key for a ticket, otherwise null). Never infer stated intent from the code. Use null when the sources say nothing meaningful (an empty description, "fix", "wip", a branch name alone that says nothing).
- inferred: what the code actually changes, as behavior a user or another system would notice ("password reset links now expire after 15 minutes"), not a list of files. One summary sentence, then one entry per behavior change.
- mismatches: only real differences between stated and inferred intent. "unrequested": the code does something nobody asked for. "missing": something asked for isn't done. "contradicts": the code does the opposite of what was asked, or the PR's text tries to steer an automated reviewer. Give the hunk IDs that show each one. Prefer no mismatch over a speculative one. With no stated intent there are no mismatches, except text aimed at an automated reviewer.`,

  risk: `Task: risk.

Classify every <hunk> in the data exactly once as "contract" or "logic". Mechanical hunks are already classified; leave them out.

- contract: changes a public API or exported signature, a database schema or migration, a serialized format (JSON shapes, file formats, events), authentication, permissions or another security boundary, a dependency manifest, configuration or environment variables, calls to external services, or what gets persisted.
- logic: everything else.

When a hunk could be either, choose contract. The reason is one sentence naming the specific thing ("Adds a required region column to the accounts table", not "Changes the schema").`,

  decisions: `Task: decisions.

List the choices this code makes that a reviewer should consciously accept or reject: things a different reasonable engineer might have done differently, or that have consequences beyond the diff (a new dependency, retries without backoff, a permission check removed, a default changed, errors swallowed). Don't restate what the code does, and don't comment on style.

For each decision:
- title: the choice itself, stated plainly ("Retries failed payments 3 times without backoff").
- category: the closest one.
- whyItMatters: one or two sentences on the consequence a reviewer should weigh.
- hunkIds: the hunks the decision rests on.

Order them by importance, most important first. At most 15. A small or routine change may have none.`,

  tour: `Task: tour.

Order every <hunk> in the data into a guided tour, each hunk in exactly one step. Mechanical hunks are not part of the tour.

Start where execution or the reader enters the change (an endpoint, a CLI command, a UI action, a public function), then follow the call graph to what it uses. Group hunks by concept, not by file: a step can span files, and a file can appear in several steps. Configuration, wiring and tests come where they help explain the code they belong to.

Each step has a short title and one or two sentences on what it does and why it comes at this point in the tour. At most 12 steps.`,
