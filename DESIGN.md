# Design

How code review should work now that most code is generated. See [MISSION.md](MISSION.md) for why.

## What review is for

1. **Catch defects:** bugs, security holes, regressions.
2. **Guard the design:** does this change belong here, and is it the right approach?
3. **Spread understanding:** at least one person besides the author knows how the system works now.
4. **Accountability:** a human signs off.

Generated code strains all four. There's far more code, the author often doesn't fully understand it, and the intent lives in a chat transcript nobody sees. Understanding suffers most: if nobody really reads the code, nobody understands the codebase.

## Why the diff view fails

The diff view was designed for a world where code was expensive and every line was written on purpose.

- Files are ordered alphabetically, so the reviewer has to rebuild the story.
- Every line gets equal weight: a lockfile bump looks as important as a removed auth check.
- It shows changed text, not changed behavior, so the reviewer simulates the program in their head.
- The intent is missing: what was asked and which alternatives were rejected.
- Comments attach to lines, but real concerns are about decisions.
- Nitpicks waste attention when code is cheap to regenerate.

## Thesis

> Review should stop being "read every changed line." It should become "approve the decisions and verify the behavior," with human attention spent according to risk.

## Principles

1. **Start from intent.** Open with what was asked (ticket, prompt, or agent-session summary) and a plain-language summary of what changed in behavior. The first question is "does this do what we wanted?"
2. **Sort every change by risk.**
   - *Mechanical:* moves, renames, formatting, generated files. Collapsed, with machine proof (e.g. "moved code verified identical").
   - *Logic:* ordinary code changes. Normal read.
   - *Contract:* public API, schema, permissions, dependencies, config, security boundaries. Where human attention goes.
3. **Guided tour.** Start at the entry point, follow the call graph, and group changes by concept so the review reads like a story, not a file tree.
4. **Review decisions, not lines.** Extract the decisions the code makes ("retries 3 times with no backoff", "adds dependency X", "stores token in localStorage") as a checklist to approve or reject. Comments attach to decisions.
5. **Evidence over code.** Show tests run and their coverage, before/after outputs, sample requests and responses, and UI screenshots.
6. **Machines go first.** AI and static tools look for bugs first. Humans see only the findings machines are confident about; nits are fixed automatically, never discussed.
7. **Ask the code.** The reviewer can ask questions ("what if `user` is null here?") and get answers grounded in the code, without checking out the branch.
8. **Close the loop with the agent.** A reviewer comment becomes an instruction to the agent; the reviewer re-reviews only the resulting delta against the decision they flagged.
9. **Depth matches risk.** Low-risk changes get auto-approved or a quick look; contract changes get a deep review. The tool picks the depth and says why.
10. **Review the plan before the code.** Approving an agent's plan is the cheapest review. Code review then becomes a conformance check against the approved plan.

## Decisions

- **Product form:** standalone web UI, served locally by a CLI, with no server of ours. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **First slice:** take a GitHub or Bitbucket Cloud PR and produce a guided review: an intent summary, hunks sorted by risk with mechanical ones collapsed, and a list of extracted decisions. This covers principles 1–4, which the rest build on.
- **Primary users:** both. A solo dev reviewing their own agent's output needs to *understand* it; a teammate reviewing someone else's PR needs to *trust* it. The same review has to serve both.
- **Intent sources:** intent is extracted, not entered by hand, from:
  - the PR description;
  - Jira tickets mentioned in the description, commits or branch name;
  - the code itself, inferred from what the change actually does.

  Stated intent (description, tickets) and intent inferred from the code are shown side by side. A mismatch between them is a finding in itself: the change does something nobody asked for, or misses something that was asked.
